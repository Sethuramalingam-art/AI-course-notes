Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or machine to mimic human-like behavior. 
For example, to mimic visual senses, speech recognition, decision-making, natural language understanding, and so on. 
It's not a technology of itself, but rather a goal set by technologists to imitate human intelligence.


Generative AI is a subset of AI. AI can be used to predict outcomes, detect entities, or classify documents, among others. 
However, generative AI, also known as GenAI, creates content, such as images, videos, or text. 
The goal is that this AI-generated content should be as useful as any created by humans. 
This approach is possible thanks to large language models (LLMs), which are complex AI models that can be used for a broad range of use cases.
